                            <p >Across Universities, introductory computer science courses face high dropout rates. UCT has introduced an Extended Degree Program course, CS1010H, to provide struggling first year computer science students with
                                the support they require. Retention of students is vital not only to the growth of the field, but to the many disciplines, academic and
                                commercial, that require computer science graduates.

                                E-learning is proposed as a solution to this problem because it is highly scalable and allows students to work at their own pace.
                                The benefits of E-learning are particularly apparent in the study
                                of computer science because it allows for a degree of interactivity that is not possible in a classroom.
