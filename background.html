					<p >Across Universities, introductory computer science courses face high dropout rates. The University of Cape Town is no stranger to this
					phenomenon and has introduced an Extended Degree Program course, CS1010H, to provide struggling first year computer science students with
					the support they require. Retention of students is vital not only to the growth of the field, but to the many disciplines, academic and
					commercial, that require computer science graduates. </p>
				<p>Proficiency in programming requires time intensive practice that students cannot feasibly complete in a classroom setting. Beginner
					programmers are also particularly vulnerable to falling behind in classes that are too fast paced for them and being able to catch up.
					E-learning has been proposed as a solution to these problems because it allows one instructor to oversee more learners than is possible
					in a classroom setting and allows students to work at their own pace. The benefits of E-learning are particularly apparent in the study
					of computer science because it allows for a degree of interactivity that is not possible in a classroom. </p>
					<p> The hype around E-learning has led to it becoming somewhat of a solve-all buzzword for all problems faced in education. While it is
					generally agreed upon that students can learn from content that is delivered electronically, there is no definitive proof to support
					many of the claims that are made by proponents of E-learning. A literature review of 96 research reports, with data cumulatively gathered from 19331
					subjects, found that E-learning initiatives were 6% more effective than traditional classroom. Other studies have found that there is no significant
					difference between E-learning and classroom instruction. </p>
					<p>The prototype developed for this project was created to test the efficiency of E-learning in assisting beginner computer science students
					in completing programming exercises. The prototype developed includes typical components of computer science E-learning systems - interactive code,
					visual debugging, automated assessment and an interactive chat - which were used to address the following research questions:  </p>
