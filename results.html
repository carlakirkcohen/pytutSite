                    <p>The prototype developed was intended to be tested with UCT's CSC1010H class, but #feesMustFall protest action across South Africa made this impossible.
                        Instead, the prototype was tested by expert users recruited from UCT's honours and masters classes. The results that follow were obtained over two iterations
                        of testing.

                        <p>The features provided were individually evaluated on their ability to engage users, aid in detection of logical and syntax errors, allow users to work at their own
                            pace and their suitability for inclusion in future E-learning systems. Across categories, the features achieved high scores. This is to be expected as the features
                            chosen are all typical to Computer Science E-learning systems.

                        <p>The automated marker outperformed the other features, performing particularly well in ability to engage users and allow them to work at their own pace. The
                            independence and interactivity that this tool offered illustrate the advantages that E-learning systems offer. Implementation of an automated marker feature
                            in future systems is highly recommended.

                        <p>The use of a simplified notepad-like code window was expected to lower the barriers to programming faced in IDEs that are typically developed for expert programmers.
                            The poor results obtained by the interactive code window in key areas such as syntax error detection indicated that this form of code execution was inappropriately simple.

                        <p>The visual debugger's low score in ability to engage users was attributed to its failure to engage users in active learning; visualization is passively observed rather
                            than interactively explored. The debate around the effectiveness of visualizations in Computer Science education has not yet reached a de
                            nitive conclusion. Future work in this
                            field is required to make more conclusive judgements on the value of visual debugging.
                        </p>
                        <p>The vital role that instructor feedback is known to have in E-learning systems is emphasized by the interactive feedback placing second by only 0.1 in the inclusion in future
                            systems category. It is possible that this feature has been a casualty of the method that this prototype was tested as expert users have no need to ask questions about beginner
                            programming tasks
