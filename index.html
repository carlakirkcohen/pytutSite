                            <p>Across Universities, introductory computer science courses face high dropout rates. The University of Cape Town is no stranger to this
                              phenomenon and has introduced an Extended Degree Program course, CS1010H, to provide struggling first year computer science students with
                              the support they require. Retention of students is vital not only to the growth of the field, but to the many disciplines, academic and
                              commercial, that require computer science graduates. </p>
                            <p>Proficiency in programming requires time intensive practice that students cannot feasibly complete in a classroom setting. Beginner
                              programmers are also particularly vulnerable to falling behind in classes that are too fast paced for them and being able to catch up.
                              E-learning has been proposed as a solution to these problems because it allows one instructor to oversee more learners than is possible
                              in a classroom setting and allows students to work at their own pace. The benefits of E-learning are particularly apparent in the study
                              of computer science because it allows for a degree of interactivity that is not possible in a classroom. </p>
                              <p> The hype around E-learning has led to it becoming somewhat of a solve-all buzzword for all problems faced in education. While it is
                              generally agreed upon that students can learn from content that is delivered electronically, there is no definitive proof to support
                              many of the claims that are made by proponents of E-learning. A literature review of 96 research reports, with data cumulatively gathered from 19331
                              subjects, found that E-learning initiatives were 6% more effective than traditional classroom. Other studies have found that there is no significant
                              difference between E-learning and classroom instruction. </p>
                              <p>The prototype developed for this project was created to test the efficiency of E-learning in assisting beginner computer science students
                              in completing programming exercises. The prototype developed includes typical components of computer science E-learning systems - interactive code,
                              visual debugging, automated assessment and an interactive chat - which were used to address the following research questions:  </p>

                            <p>This project seeks to determine the true benefits of introducing  an e-learning system as a supplement to traditional instruction in a
                              beginners programming course. A review of available literature suggests that the combination of e-learning and traditional classroom
                              instruction can be highly effective. It is proposed that instead of pitting the two methods against one another, research into how
                            the two methods can complement each other should be completed. Development of E-learning is a time and capital intensive process. It is
                            important to determine whether the benefits of using an E-learning system equal the cost. <b>Ross add more here?</b> </p>
                            <p>In addition to examining the impact of introducing E-Learning as a supplement to classroom instruction, this project aims to determine
                            how the components included in the prototype (interactive code, visual debugging, automated assessment and interactive feedback - all typical
                            components of an E-learning system) can aid beginner programmers in completing programming tasks. Determining which features are most helpful
                            to students is important for the development of future E-learning platforms. Inclusion of features that are not helpful to or used by students runs
                            the risk of confusing or distracting students from the task at hand. </p>

                            <p >The individual features were asessed by expert using a 1-5 likert scale to evaluate how effective they were in assisting beginner programmers in
                              tasks that beginner programmers are likely to perform and their suitability for use in a E-learning system. The categories examined were ability to
                              engage students, detection of syntax errors, detection of logical errors, ability to work at own pace and suitability for implementation in future
                            E-learning systems. </p>
                            <p>Across categories, the features provided by the prototype achieved high scores. This is partially to be expected because the features that were included in the
                              prototype were chosen because of their common use in Computer Science E-learning systems. The few exceptions to this statement were to be expected; for example,
                               the interactive feedback feature did scored below 3 for the ability for detect logical and syntax errors.  </p>
                               <img src="img/totalScore.png" class ="resultImg" alt="">
                               <p>The automated marker out-performed the other features in four of the five categories tested, making it the clear front runner among the features tested. Of
                                 particular interest is its high score for the ability to engage learners, 4.6/5, which confirms the expectation laid out by reinforcement theory that the
                                 promise of assessment motivates students to engage with the task at hand. The automated marker scored 0.5 higher than the next best feature
                                 in the ability to let students work at their own pace. This is one of the key advantages of using E-learning to deliver content. Suggestions that the automated
                                 marker feature should point out areas in the code where students are likely to have made errors are beyond the scope of a simple black box based automated
                                 marker. These suggestions emphasize the limitations mentioned in this paper's literature review of an automated marker's ability to produce the same quality
                                 of feedback that interaction with an instructor can provide. </p>
                                 <p>The use of a simplified notepad-like frame for users to code in was intended to remove the confusion of the unnecessarily complex features that IDEs provide
                                   beginner programmers, a known barrier to programming for beginners. Despite obtaining the second highest overall score across categories,
                                   the interactive code feature did not perform as well as expected. The open ended questions revealed that the simplicity of the feature detracted from its score
                                   rather than adding value, with multiple users raising concerns about the simplistic way in which syntax errors were highlighted and reported. The main concern
                                   raised was that this simple feature was not superior to service-rich IDEs. Simple notepad-like frames for executing code have been found to significantly aid
                                   learning by Tang (2015), but the frames were only used for execution of pre-loaded code to illustrate a programming concept. The results
                                   obtained indicate that a simple code execution environment is insufficient for writing and debugging of code. The ability to execute code is essential to an
                                   E-learning system, but a more feature-rich environment appears to be required.</p>
